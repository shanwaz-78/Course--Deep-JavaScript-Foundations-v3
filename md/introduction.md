# Introduction.
* We will see the introduction of it with some basic codes of js.

```Javascript
let num = 40;

num++; // it's called postfixed position increament. 40
console.log(num); // 41

++num; // it's called pre increment 42
console.log(num); // 42

```
_Whenever We increment a num using postfixed position it will be return the value first, after that he will be increment the num_.

_Whenever we will use pre increment position for increment a num. it will increment num first, after that he will be return value_.

---
here is a string which is representing a num;

_Whenever we use __num2 = num2 + 1__ it will not increment a number it will be concat to that string_.

_Whenever we use postfixed position it will be increment to that string number but the main thing is it will change the data type of it string to number automatically_.
```Javascript
let num2 = '5';
num2 = num2 + 1; //'51'


num2++ // 51
console.log(num2) // 52

```
