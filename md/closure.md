> # Closure

Closures are defined as inner functions that have access to variables and parameters of outer function even after the outer function has returned. The below examples show the practical use of closures :

```javascript
function mulFn() {
  var mul = 9;
  return function (val) {
    mul = mul * val;
    return mul;
  };
}

var mul = mulfn();
console.log(mul); // function anonymous
console.log(mul(13));
```

## Module Pattern

The module Pattern is one of the important patterns in Javascript. It is a commonly used Design Pattern which is used to wrap a set of varaibles and functions together in a single scope.

- It is used to define objects and specify the variables and the functions that can be accessed from outside the scope of the function.

- We expose certain properties and function as public and can also restirct the scope of properties and functions within the object itself, making them private.

- We can achieve data hiding an abrastraction using this pattern.

```javascript
function EmployeeDetails() {
  var name = "Mayank";
  var age = 30;
  var designation = "Developer";
  var salary = "50000";

  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    designation: designation,
  };
}

var newEmployee = EmployeeDetails();

var userName = newEmployee.name;
var userAge = newEmployee.age;
var userDesignation = newEmployee.designation;
var usersalary = newEmployee.salary;

console.log(userName);
console.log(userAge);
console.log(userDesignation);
console.log(newEmployee);
console.log(usersalary);
```
