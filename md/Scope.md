# Scopes.

Scopes in javascript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibilty of variables to javascript.
Javascript has the following kinds of scopes:-
* Global Scope
* Module Scope
* Function Scope
* Block Scope
* Lexical Scope

## Global Scope :-
Variables defined outside any function, block, or module scope have everywhere in the application. when a module system is enabled it's harder to make global variables,but one can still do it. By defining a variable in HTML, outside any function, a global variable can be created.

## Module Scope :-
Before modules, a variable declared outside any function was a global variable. In modules, a variable declared outside any function is hidden and not available to other modules unless it is explicity exported..

## Block Scope :-
Block scope is defined with curly braces. it is separated by { and }. Variables declared with let and const can have block scope. They can only be accessed in the block in which they are defined.

## Function Scope :-
Function scope means that parameters and variables defined in a function are visible everywhere within the function, but are not visible outside of the function.

## Lexical Scope :-
Lexical scope is tha ability of the inner function to access the outer scope in which is defined.
