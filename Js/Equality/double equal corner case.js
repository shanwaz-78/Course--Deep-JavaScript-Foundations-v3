// if ([] == false) {, when we compare a primitive to non primitive we have to turn a non primitive.
// into primitive. and what does he becomes he becomes empty string.

// if ('' == false) {, now we have both primitive values but nor the same data types.
// and algorithm prefers they both becomes number.

// if (0 == false) {, now we have one number and also a boolean and it has to convert it into a number.

// if (0 === 0) {, now we used strict equality coz now we have two numbers and even same data types.
